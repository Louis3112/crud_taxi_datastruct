My project for Data Structure 2nd Semester.

The project implements various of data structure concepts, such as :
1. Linked list (for access data driver/*supir*)
2. Queue (for order queuing)
3. Stack (for access data car)                                    

The project is developed using Functional programming, C++ language, runs on CLI, and requires only a minimal set of library to use (doesn't require installing any library from outside)
This is a simple project so don't expect anything from it
